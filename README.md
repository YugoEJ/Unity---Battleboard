# Battle-Board
Video Game Development Course Project - Sapir College 2021/2022

The concept of the video game is as follows: 

There is a board that is split into two halves, and there are 2 players (Human VS Computer), each on their own half of the board. 

Each player rolls a single (1-6) die and moves the corresponding amount of steps on the board. 
Every 50 total dice rolls a Special Minigame will initiate. 

There will be (randomly selected) "Special Tiles" on each half of the board: Green Tiles and Red Tiles. 
If a player lands on a Red Tile, they will be stuck in place for one turn, and the opposing player will get to move twice. 
If a player lands on a Green Tile, they will receive 1 Health Point (max 2), which will aid them in the Special Minigame. 

In the Special Minigame, both the Player and the Computer will have to avoid falling objects by moving left and right.
If a player is hit, they lose 1 Health Point - first to lose all of their Health Points loses the Minigame. 

The winner of the Special Minigame will advance 6 steps on the board.
The first player to reach the end of their half of the board – wins.
